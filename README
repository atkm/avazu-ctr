train has 40M lines.
test has 4M.

Model ideas:
- To reduce the number of features when encoding a categorical variable, use count, ranking by count, or probability of each category.
    Other ways to deal with the same issue: feature hashing, embeding into a vector space (embedding_column in tf).
    Look into "locally sensitive hashing" algorithms in Spark.
